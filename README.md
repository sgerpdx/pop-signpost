## My Portfolio Site

Note on the code: Believe it or not, this repo began simply as the base for a single-page placeholder in lieu of my 'real' site, a longer-term project. One thing led to another and long story short, this little signpost acquired an improvisational complexity beyond my initial intent.

As such, refactoring and simplification of theme and styling are ongoing efforts, as I work to make the code more efficient and readable, now that the nature of the thing is known.

### Credits + Resources

After a bit of a search for an easy-to-implement approach to page transitions, I came across and made use of [this excellent tutorial](https://wallis.dev/blog/nextjs-page-transitions-with-framer-motion) by James Wallis.
