## My Portfolio Site

Code Note: This repo began simply as the base for a single-page placeholder in lieu of a longer-term full site project. One thing led to another and this little 'signpost' acquired an improvisational complexity well beyond the initially-planned scope.

As such, refactoring and simplification of theme and styling are ongoing efforts, as I work to make the code more efficient and readable, now that the nature of the thing is known.

### Credits + Resources

After a search for an easy-to-implement approach to page transitions, I came across and made use of [this excellent tutorial](https://wallis.dev/blog/nextjs-page-transitions-with-framer-motion) by James Wallis.
