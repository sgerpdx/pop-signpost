//// advice from: https://github.com/vercel/next.js/issues/26749
//// however this is for a typescript repo so doesn't work for me

// import React, { ReactElement } from "react";

// const mock = (props: { children: ReactElement }): ReactElement => {
//   return <>{props.children}</>;
// };

// export default mock;
