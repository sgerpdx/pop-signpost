        A &apos;daily-reveal calendar app&apos; that&apos;s an outgrowth of a
        digital Advent Calendar I built as a Christmas gift. It will allow the
        user to create an account and set up customized calendars that
        facilitate content-reveals at scheduled intervals, e.g. today&apos;s
        'door' can be opened by the recipient-user, who will then be able to
        access whatever information or media the admin-user has loaded behind
        that door.

        <li>Back-end: Firebase</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        I&apos;m also planning to implement TypeScript and Tailwind CSS once the
        core functionality is in place.
