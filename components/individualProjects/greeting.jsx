        Random generative art creation tool with gallery and send-as-eCard
        service. Built in two-week remote team sprint, using:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>React + Node</li>
        <li>p5.js</li>
        <li>AWS</li>
        <li>SendGrid</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        My role: I initiated and coordinated the project; wrote customized
        art-rendering functions in p5.js with added randomization logic;
        designed the interface from wireframe through CSS, including
        incorporation of Material-UI components; and did general testing and
        debugging throughout.
